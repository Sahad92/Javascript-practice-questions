Write a function `sumArray(arr)` that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the elements.

---

### **Problem 2: Find the Largest Number**

Write a function `findLargest(arr)` that returns the largest number in an array.

---

### **Problem 3: Reverse an Array**

Write a function `reverseArray(arr)` that takes an array and returns a new array with the elements in reverse order.

---

### **Problem 4: Remove Duplicates from an Array**

Write a function `removeDuplicates(arr)` that removes duplicate elements from an array and returns a new array with unique elements.

---

### **Problem 5: Merge Two Arrays**

Write a function `mergeArrays(arr1, arr2)` that merges two arrays into one and returns the combined array.

---

### **Problem 6: Check if an Array is Sorted**

Write a function `isSorted(arr)` that returns `true` if the array is sorted in ascending order, and `false` otherwise.

---

### **Problem 7: Find the Index of an Element**

Write a function `findIndex(arr, element)` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr`, or `-1` if it is not found.

---

### **Problem 8: Flatten a Nested Array**

Write a function `flattenArray(arr)` that flattens a nested array by one level.


---

### **Problem 9: Count Occurrences of an Element**
