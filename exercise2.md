1. String Manipulation

Program 1:
Write a function that takes a user’s full name as input. Perform the following operations:
	•	Remove any leading and trailing whitespaces.
	•	Convert the full name to uppercase letters.
	•	Replace any occurrence of the word “JUNIOR” with “JR”.
	•	Split the full name into an array of first name and last name.
	•	Return the transformed name and the array.

Topics covered: trim(), toUpperCase(), replace(), split()

Program 2:
Ask the user to enter a sentence. Perform the following:
	•	Find the length of the sentence.
	•	Find the index of the first occurrence of the word “JavaScript”.
	•	Extract a substring starting from the word “JavaScript” to the end of the sentence.
	•	Check if the sentence includes the word “developer”.

Topics covered: length, indexOf(), substring(), includes()

2. Numbers and Math Functions

Program 3:
Create a simple calculator that:
	•	Takes two numbers as input.
	•	Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
	•	Rounds the results to two decimal places.
	•	Displays the results in a localized string format.

Topics covered: arithmetic operations, toFixed(), toLocaleString()

Program 4:
Generate a random integer between 1 and 50. Then:
	•	Ask the user to guess the number.
	•	Provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
	•	Continue until the user guesses correctly.
	•	Count the number of attempts taken.

Topics covered: Math.random(), Math.floor(), comparison operators

3. Date and Time

Program 5:
Write a program that:
	•	Gets the current date and time.
	•	Formats the date as “Weekday, Month Day, Year”.
	•	Calculates and displays the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970.

Topics covered: new Date(), toDateString(), getTime()

Program 6:
Ask the user to enter their birth date in the format “YYYY-MM-DD”. Then:
	•	Create a Date object from the input.
	•	Calculate the user’s age in years.
	•	Determine the day of the week they were born.

Topics covered: new Date(), getFullYear(), getDay()

Program 7:

Create a program that:
	•	Current Date and Time: Gets the current date and time using new Date().
	•	String Conversion:
	•	Converts the date to a string using toString().
	•	Converts the date to a locale-specific string using toLocaleString().
	•	Type Determination: Determines the data type of the date object using typeof.
	•	Specific Date Objects:
	•	Creates a date object for January 23, 2023, using new Date(2023, 0, 23).
	•	Creates a date object with specific time using new Date(2023, 0, 23, 5, 3).

Topics covered: new Date(), toString(), toLocaleString(), typeof, date constructors
