/***1. Basic Mathematical Operation Function**  
**Goal:** Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their product.  
**Details:**  
- Prompt the user (or define variables in your code) for two numbers.  
- Convert the input strings to numbers (if they are taken as strings) before passing them into the function.  
- Use the returned product from the function and log it to the console.  
- Use `Math.round()` on the final result to ensure itâ€™s an integer.
