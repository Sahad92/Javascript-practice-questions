/*
7. Memory Allocation (Stack and Heap)
Problem: Write a simple program that demonstrates the distinction between primitive and reference data types.
Create a primitive value (e.g., let a = 10) and a reference type (e.g., let b = {key: "value"}), and show how each is handled differently in memory.
Test the behavior of copying and modifying both types.
