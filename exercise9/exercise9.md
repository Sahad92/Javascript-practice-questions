## ðŸš€ **1. Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `else if`)**

**Problem:**  
Write a program that takes an **exam score** as input and evaluates the grade based on the following conditions:  
- `90 or above`: Grade A  
- `80-89`: Grade B  
- `70-79`: Grade C  
- `60-69`: Grade D  
- `Below 60`: Grade F  

Also, print whether the student **"Passed"** (score â‰¥ 60) or **"Failed"**.

## ðŸš€ **2. Logical Operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)**

**Problem:**  
Create a program that checks if a **user is eligible for a discount** on an online purchase.  
- The user must be **logged in**.  
- They must have a **valid membership card** or have **made a purchase above $100**.  
- They must **not** have any **pending payments**.  

Print `"Eligible for Discount"` if all conditions are met, otherwise print `"Not Eligible"`.

## ðŸš€ **3. Comparison Operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`)**

**Problem:**  
Write a program that compares **two numbers** (`a` and `b`) provided by the user. Print:  
- `"a is greater"` if `a > b`  
- `"b is greater"` if `b > a`  
- `"Both are equal"` if `a === b`  
- Make sure the program differentiates between a **number comparison** and a **string comparison**.

---

## ðŸš€ **4. Scope (`let`, `const`, `var`)**

**Problem:**  
Write a program that declares a variable using `let` inside an `if` block and another variable using `var` inside the same `if` block. Try to access both variables **inside and outside** the `if` block.  
Explain in comments why one works and the other throws an error (or doesn't behave as expected).

---

## ðŸš€ **5. Ternary Operator (`? :`)**

**Problem:**  
Write a program to check whether a **user's age** makes them eligible to vote. Use the **ternary operator** to print:  
- `"Eligible to vote"` if the age is `18 or above`  
- `"Not eligible to vote"` otherwise  

---

## ðŸš€ **6. Multiple Conditions with Logical Operators**

**Problem:**  
Write a program to validate a **user login system** with the following conditions:  
- The **username** must be `"admin"`.  
- The **password** must be `"password123"`.  
- The **user must have 2FA enabled** (`twoFactorAuthEnabled = true`).  

Print `"Login Successful"` if all conditions are met, otherwise print `"Login Failed"`.

---

## ðŸš€ **7. Inline `if` Statements**

**Problem:**  
Write a program that checks a user's **account balance**:  
- If the balance is `greater than 1000`, print `"Sufficient Funds"`.  
- If the balance is `less than 500`, print `"Low Balance"`.  

Use an **inline `if` statement** (without braces `{}`) for this task.

---

## ðŸš€ **8. Nested Conditions**

**Problem:**  
Write a program that evaluates whether a **person can board an international flight** based on the following conditions:  
1. The person must have a **valid passport**.  
2. If the passport is valid, check if the **visa is valid**.  
3. If the visa is valid, check if the person has a **boarding pass**.  

If all conditions are satisfied, print `"Allowed to Board"`, otherwise print `"Not Allowed to Board"`.
